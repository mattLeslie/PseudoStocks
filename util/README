Hello!

 My JDBCConnector code uses 'root' for both username and password,
 so this project shouldn't require any configuration beyond running 
 the A4_sql_script.sql in a new query on MySQL Workbench. Then, you should
 be able to run the project folder on an instance of Tomcat. 

Thank you.
